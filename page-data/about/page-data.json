We will bring together a diverse group\nof experts from the sciences and humanities to facilitate a multifaceted\nreflection on the topic.  Part of the topics will be of a general nature and\nwill attempt to answer the following questions: What is generative AI? How do\nimage-generating neural networks work? What are their social and philosophical\nimplications? Another section will identify the technical specificities of\ngenerative AI and contrast them with conceptions of creativity developed in\nphilosophy and particularly in aesthetics. We would like to discuss the role of\nrandomness and explore its relation to chaotic systems, the different types of\nuse of randomness in generative AI and the role of randomness in creative and\nartistic production. Other characterising elements will also be\nresearched. Finally, the focus will be on the relationship between creation and\ngeneration and the identification of a creative process within the AI\narchitecture.</p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>During the invited and contributed talks, we hope to touch on the following\n(non-exhaustive!) list of topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Generative AI</li>\n<li>Creativity of neural networks</li>\n<li>Difference between creation and generation</li>\n<li>Randomness of AI</li>\n<li>Chaotic systems</li>\n<li>Machine Learning</li>\n<li>Latent Space</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"a1b799d5-68ca-5db2-b4cb-b7839b5a8121"}},
